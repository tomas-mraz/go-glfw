# GLFW 3.3 for Go [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/vulkan-go/glfw/v3.3/glfw?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/vulkan-go/glfw/v3.3/glfw)

This is a fork with MoltenVK support, also because of MinGW bug that fixed in Go 1.8 only. Also before the official GLFW 3.3 release. So expect this repo to be deleted, probably around end of Feb 2017.

Latest GLFW tip: `6e7202f2d691ed1d79bcdaed6cce0061006ce565`.

## Installation
